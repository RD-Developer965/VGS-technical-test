## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a complete implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.  
It is split into two main parts:

1. **Backend** â€“ powered by Spring Boot, responsible for handling the game logic, persistence, and APIs.  
2. **Frontend** â€“ built with React, providing a modern user interface for playing the game.  

Each part has its own `README.md` file with detailed setup and usage instructions.
